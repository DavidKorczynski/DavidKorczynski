## Software security at the core

I'm a security researcher with [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com) where I specialize in security
research and development, as well as vulnerability analysis services.

I focus on **fuzzing**, **vulnerability analysis**, **program analysis**, **LLM-based research**, and more broadly **automation of offensive security research**.

I contribute to a lot of open source projects, including:

- [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz)
- [Fuzz Introspector](https://github.com/ossf/fuzz-introspector)
- [OSS-Fuzz-gen](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-gen)

I also audit software together with my colleagues and you can see a subset of vulns disclosed to GitHub projects [here](https://github.com/advisories?query=credit%3ADavidKorczynski) and [here](https://github.com/advisories?query=credit%3AAdamKorcz).

If you'd like to work together in a professional context please get in contact via my listed email or via Ada Logic's contact [here](https://adalogics.com/contact).

Prior to Ada Logics, I completed my PhD at University of Oxford where I researched techniques for
automating reverse engineering of advanced malware. My thesis is publicly available: [Automated analysis of system-wide malware propagation](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ef3faf5e-7733-4460-bba4-9e18893dec1e).
