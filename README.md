I'm a security researcher with [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com) where I specialize in security
research and development, as well as vulnerability analysis services.

Prior to this, I was doing a PhD at University of Oxford where I researched techniques for
automating reverse engineering. My thesis is publicly available: [Automated analysis of system-wide malware propagation](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ef3faf5e-7733-4460-bba4-9e18893dec1e).

With Ada Logics I focus on **fuzzing**, **vulnerability analysis**, **program analysis** and more broadly **automation of offensive security research**.

I contribute to a lot of open source projects, including:

- [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz)
- [Fuzz Introspector](https://github.com/ossf/fuzz-introspector)
-  [OSS-Fuzz-gen](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz-gen)

I also audit software together with my colleagues and you can see a subset of vulns disclosed to GitHub projects [here](https://github.com/advisories?query=credit%3ADavidKorczynski) and [here](https://github.com/advisories?query=credit%3AAdamKorcz).

Reach out if you have software security research and development needs or auditing projects. I'm always open for interesting projects and if you'd like to work together in a professional context please get in contact via my listed email or via Ada Logic's contact [here](https://adalogics.com/contact).
